Write a Python program to count occurrences of a substring in a string.

string = "The long-string instrument is a musical instrument in which the string is of such a length that the " \
         "fundamental transverse wave is below what a person can hear as a tone (20 Hz). If the tension and the " \
         "length result in sounds with such a frequency, the tone becomes a beating frequency that ranges from a short " \
         "reverb (approx 5â€“10 meters) to longer echo sounds (longer than 10 meters). Besides the beating frequency, " \
         "the string also gives higher pitched natural overtones. Since the length is that long, this has an effect on " \
         "the attack tone. The attack tone shoots through the string in a longitudinal wave and generates the typical " \
         "science-fiction laser-gun sound as heard in Star Wars.[1] The sound is also similar to that occurring in " \
         "upper electricity cables for trains (which are ready made long-string instruments in a way)."


print string.count('string')

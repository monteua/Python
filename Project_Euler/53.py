Combinatoric selections
Problem 53 
There are exactly ten ways of selecting three from five, 12345:

123, 124, 125, 134, 135, 145, 234, 235, 245, and 345

In combinatorics, we use the notation, 5C3 = 10.

How many, not necessarily distinct, values of  nCr, for 1 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 100, are greater than one-million?
